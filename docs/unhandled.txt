things to change on new mac

* font in meld apparently.
* mission control shortcut keys default to ctrl+down... maybe they didn't work with the high F-keys because you don't have that keyboard attached? Investigate... Set all to nothing for now, depend on hot corners (which were totally right with my config btw).
* disable "add period with double space", "capitalize words automatically", "correct spelling automatically", "use smart quotes", remove "on my way" shortcut.
* disable "automatically adjust brightness" on main display.
* set file-type associations - mp4 = vlc, text = vscode, etc.
* change the main monitor by going into displays and dragging menu bar to the main display. This affects things like your volume control showing up only on your laptop screen even when you have an external display connected.
* System Preferences -> General -> uncheck "close windows when quitting an app"
* no itunes notification on song change
* for finder, "always show file extensions", and "don't warn when changing a file extension"
* uncheck ctrl+space from "select previous input source" (keyboard shortcuts->input sources)
* uncheck 'move left a space', 'move right a space' (ctrl ←→) (keyboard shortcuts->mission control)
