"""Join a list of strings into one string.

So often, I have a list of strings intended for subprocess.run that I need to
try to execute directly on the shell, and I have to manually take out all the
commas and quote characters first.

cmd = ['echo', 'hello', 'world']
subprocess.run(cmd)

Here's how this program should work:

$ echo "['echo', 'hello', 'world']" | cmdstr
echo hello world

import shlex
import sys
from pathlib import *

cmd = sys.stdin.read()
if sys.argv[1:2] == ['-r']: # 'reverse': shell to python
    print(repr(shlex.split(cmd)), end='')
else: # normal: python to shell
    print(' '.join(map(shlex.quote, map(str, eval(cmd)))), end='')
