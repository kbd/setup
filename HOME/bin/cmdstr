"""Join a list of strings into one string.

So often, I have a list of strings intended for subprocess.run that I need to
try to execute directly on the shell, and I have to manually take out all the
commas and quote characters first.

cmd = ['echo', 'hello', 'world']
subprocess.run(cmd)

Here's how this program should work:

$ echo "['echo', 'hello', 'world']" | cmdstr
echo hello world

if not cmd:
    sys.exit(1)
print(' '.join(eval(cmd)), end='')
